# MarvelApp

This application is intended to list Super Heroes being presented on [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/)

## Architecture

I started structuring the project with MVC, but then I saw that it would have an approach and grow better structured with MVVM where I could separate a logic in the ViewModel layer, respecting the principles of design patterns like SRP and Observable.

## Requirements

- Xcode 10.2
- Swift 4+
- No libs

## Improvments

- Implement tests in logic of business layer;
- Implement UI Tests

### Important!!

For application we are providing the keys for testing and general use, but if you wanted to test with your account you need to create an account at [https://developer.marvel.com/]() and register your public key and private key.
